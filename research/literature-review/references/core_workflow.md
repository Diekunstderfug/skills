# Core Workflow

Before executing a systematic search, complete the [search strategy audit](search_audit.md) and save the [audit record](../assets/search_audit_template.md). Repeat affected checks after query changes.

All shell examples use paths relative to the skill directory. Run them from that directory, or resolve script paths against it; keep review outputs in the research project. Read the routing and limitations in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) first.

## Core Workflow

Literature reviews follow a structured, multi-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Planning and Scoping

1. **Define Research Question**: Use PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) for clinical/biomedical reviews
   - Example: "What is the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 (I) for treating sickle cell disease (P) compared to standard care (C)?"

2. **Establish Scope and Objectives**:
   - Define clear, specific research questions
   - Determine review type (narrative, systematic, scoping, meta-analysis)
   - Set boundaries (time period, geographic scope, study types)

3. **Develop Search Strategy**:
   - Identify 2-4 main concepts from research question
   - List synonyms, abbreviations, and related terms for each concept
   - Plan Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine terms
   - Select minimum 3 complementary databases

4. **Set Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Date range (e.g., last 10 years: 2015-2024)
   - Language (typically English, or specify multilingual)
   - Publication types (peer-reviewed, preprints, reviews)
   - Study designs (RCTs, observational, in vitro, etc.)
   - Document all criteria clearly

### Phase 2: Systematic Literature Search

1. **Multi-Database Search**:

   Select databases appropriate for the domain:

   **Biomedical & Life Sciences:**
   - Search PubMed via NCBI E-Utilities; use local `lit_search.py --source pm` for bounded exploratory searches.
   - For bioRxiv/medRxiv, consult the corresponding `paper-lookup` API reference and verify each endpoint's supported filters.
   - Use `bioservices` skill for ChEMBL, KEGG, UniProt, etc.

   **General Scientific Literature:**
   - Search arXiv via direct API (preprints in physics, math, CS, q-bio)
   - Search Semantic Scholar via API (200M+ papers, cross-disciplinary)
   - Use Google Scholar for comprehensive coverage (manual or careful scraping)

   **Specialized Databases:**
   - Use `gget alphafold` for protein structures
   - Use `gget cosmic` for cancer genomics
   - Use `datacommons-client` for demographic/statistical data
   - Use specialized databases as appropriate for the domain

2. **Document Search Parameters**:
   ```markdown
   ## Search Strategy

   ### Database: PubMed
   - **Date searched**: 2024-10-25
   - **Date range**: 2015-01-01 to 2024-10-25
   - **Search string**:
     ```
     ("CRISPR"[Title] OR "Cas9"[Title])
     AND ("sickle cell"[MeSH] OR "SCD"[Title/Abstract])
     AND 2015:2024[Publication Date]
     ```
   - **Results**: 247 articles
   ```

   Repeat for each database searched.

3. **Export and Aggregate Results**:
   - Export results in JSON format from each database
   - Combine all results into a single file
   - Use `scripts/search_databases.py` for post-processing:
     ```bash
     python scripts/search_databases.py combined_results.json \
       --deduplicate \
       --format markdown \
       --output aggregated_results.md
     ```

### Phase 3: Screening and Selection

1. **Deduplication**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/search_databases.py results.json --deduplicate --output unique_results.json
   ```
   - Removes duplicates by DOI (primary) or title (fallback)
   - Document number of duplicates removed

2. **Title Screening**:
   - Review all titles against inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Exclude obviously irrelevant studies
   - Document number excluded at this stage

3. **Abstract Screening**:
   - Read abstracts of remaining studies
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria rigorously
   - Document reasons for exclusion

4. **Full-Text Screening**:
   - Obtain full texts of remaining studies
   - Conduct detailed review against all criteria
   - Document specific reasons for exclusion
   - Record final number of included studies

5. **Create PRISMA Flow Diagram**:
   ```
   Initial search: n = X
   ├─ After deduplication: n = Y
   ├─ After title screening: n = Z
   ├─ After abstract screening: n = A
   └─ Included in review: n = B
   ```

### Phase 4: Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

1. **Extract Key Data** from each included study:
   - Study metadata (authors, year, journal, DOI)
   - Study design and methods
   - Sample size and population characteristics
   - Key findings and results
   - Limitations noted by authors
   - Funding sources and conflicts of interest

2. **Assess Study Quality**:
   - **For RCTs**: Use Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
   - **For observational studies**: Use Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
   - **For systematic reviews**: Use AMSTAR 2
   - Rate each study: High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low quality
   - Consider excluding very low-quality studies

3. **Organize by Themes**:
   - Identify 3-5 major themes across studies
   - Group studies by theme (studies may appear in multiple themes)
   - Note patterns, consensus, and controversies

### Phase 5: Synthesis and Analysis

1. **Create Review Document** from template:
   ```bash
   cp assets/review_template.md my_literature_review.md
   ```

2. **Write Thematic Synthesis** (NOT study-by-study summaries):
   - Organize Results section by themes or research questions
   - Synthesize findings across multiple studies within each theme
   - Compare and contrast different approaches and results
   - Identify consensus areas and points of controversy
   - Highlight the strongest evidence

   Example structure:
   ```markdown
   #### 3.3.1 Theme: CRISPR Delivery Methods

   Multiple delivery approaches have been investigated for therapeutic
   gene editing. Viral vectors (AAV) were used in 15 studies^1-15^ and
   showed high transduction efficiency (65-85%) but raised immunogenicity
   concerns^3,7,12^. In contrast, lipid nanoparticles demonstrated lower
   efficiency (40-60%) but improved safety profiles^16-23^.
   ```

3. **Critical Analysis**:
   - Evaluate methodological strengths and limitations across studies
   - Assess quality and consistency of evidence
   - Identify knowledge gaps and methodological gaps
   - Note areas requiring future research

4. **Write Discussion**:
   - Interpret findings in broader context
   - Discuss clinical, practical, or research implications
   - Acknowledge limitations of the review itself
   - Compare with previous reviews if applicable
   - Propose specific future research directions

### Phase 6: Citation Verification

**CRITICAL**: All citations must be verified for accuracy before final submission.

1. **Verify All DOIs**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_citations.py my_literature_review.md
   ```

   This script:
   - Extracts all DOIs from the document
   - Verifies each DOI resolves correctly
   - Retrieves metadata from CrossRef
   - Generates verification report
   - Outputs properly formatted citations

2. **Review Verification Report**:
   - Check for any failed DOIs
   - Verify author names, titles, and publication details match
   - Correct any errors in the original document
   - Re-run verification until all citations pass

3. **Format Citations Consistently**:
   - Choose one citation style and use throughout (see `references/citation_styles.md`)
   - Common styles: APA, Nature, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE
   - Use verification script output to format citations correctly
   - Ensure in-text citations match reference list format

### Phase 7: Document Generation

1. **Generate PDF**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_pdf.py my_literature_review.md \
     --citation-style apa \
     --output my_review.pdf
   ```

   Options:
   - `--citation-style`: apa, nature, chicago, vancouver, ieee
   - `--no-toc`: Disable table of contents
   - `--no-numbers`: Disable section numbering
   - `--check-deps`: Check if pandoc/xelatex are installed

2. **Review Final Output**:
   - Check PDF formatting and layout
   - Verify all sections are present
   - Ensure citations render correctly
   - Check that figures/tables appear properly
   - Verify table of contents is accurate

3. **Quality Checklist**:
   - [ ] All DOIs verified with verify_citations.py
   - [ ] Citations formatted consistently
   - [ ] PRISMA flow diagram included (for systematic reviews)
   - [ ] Search methodology fully documented
   - [ ] Inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly stated
   - [ ] Results organized thematically (not study-by-study)
   - [ ] Quality assessment completed
   - [ ] Limitations acknowledged
   - [ ] References complete and accurate
   - [ ] PDF generates without errors

## Best Practices

### Search Strategy
1. **Use multiple databases** (minimum 3): Ensures comprehensive coverage
2. **Include preprint servers**: Captures latest unpublished findings
3. **Document everything**: Search strings, dates, result counts for reproducibility
4. **Test and refine**: Run pilot searches, review results, adjust search terms

### Screening and Selection
1. **Use clear criteria**: Document inclusion/exclusion criteria before screening
2. **Screen systematically**: Title → Abstract → Full text
3. **Document exclusions**: Record reasons for excluding studies
4. **Consider dual screening**: For systematic reviews, have two reviewers screen independently

### Synthesis
1. **Organize thematically**: Group by themes, NOT by individual studies
2. **Synthesize across studies**: Compare, contrast, identify patterns
3. **Be critical**: Evaluate quality and consistency of evidence
4. **Identify gaps**: Note what's missing or understudied

### Quality and Reproducibility
1. **Assess study quality**: Use appropriate quality assessment tools
2. **Verify all citations**: Run verify_citations.py script
3. **Document methodology**: Provide enough detail for others to reproduce
4. **Follow guidelines**: Use PRISMA for systematic reviews

### Writing
1. **Be objective**: Present evidence fairly, acknowledge limitations
2. **Be systematic**: Follow structured template
3. **Be specific**: Include numbers, statistics, effect sizes where available
4. **Be clear**: Use clear headings, logical flow, thematic organization

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Single database search**: Misses relevant papers; always search multiple databases
2. **No search documentation**: Makes review irreproducible; document all searches
3. **Study-by-study summary**: Lacks synthesis; organize thematically instead
4. **Unverified citations**: Leads to errors; always run verify_citations.py
5. **Too broad search**: Yields thousands of irrelevant results; refine with specific terms
6. **Too narrow search**: Misses relevant papers; include synonyms and related terms
7. **Ignoring preprints**: Misses latest findings; include bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv
8. **No quality assessment**: Treats all evidence equally; assess and report quality
9. **Publication bias**: Only positive results published; note potential bias
10. **Outdated search**: Field evolves rapidly; clearly state search date
